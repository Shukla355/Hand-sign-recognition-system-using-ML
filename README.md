# Hand-sign-recognition-system-using-ML
Hand sign recognition systems using machine learning (ML) empower computers to understand human gestures made by hand movements. These systems utilize algorithms that are trained on vast datasets containing various hand signs. Once trained, they can identify and interpret these signs in real-time. Their applications range from assisting the differently-abled, facilitating silent communication, to enhancing user experience in augmented and virtual reality. The core of these systems lies in image processing and deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). With advancements in ML and increased computing power, hand sign recognition is becoming more accurate, paving the way for more intuitive human-computer interactions.
